# friend-finder
## About
 This repo contains my app called FriendFinder, which essentially functions as a dating application. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match, using Express to handle the routing capabiities. 

## Tech Stack
* Javascipt (Jquery)
* HTMl
* CSS (Bootstrap)

## Organization
The app is organized into an app folder which contains the directories for the working application. The app folder contains the files for genreating the HTML, CSS and the survey. I am using a custom generated API to match friends.

## Future Development

I would like to determine a better way to include CSS styling outside of inline Javascript while using the server.
